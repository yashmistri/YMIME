spring 26 mission: extended procedural animation system
animated character with code with minimum use of animation curves
features:
	walk, strafe, run: all same function
	new function: move hand- animates whole body with focus around right hand
		given target position of right hand move body in natural way to match pose
		rules:
			feet try to remain balanced under center of mass
			the heavier the object in RH the more anticipation and follow through
			torso tries to find a natural transform between arms and feet
			for changes in rot hand tries to execute arc motion
		recursive function: executes different movements depending on position and rotation of RH
			executes one movement at a time until RH reaches target transform
			uses queue for multi part movements
		priority list for shift in position:
			if close and forward then just move RH to target
			if farther then lunge towards target
			if farther then dash towards target
		prio for change in rotation:
			if 180 deg in weapon up axis: do a flip or twist belly up
		anticipation/follow through: torso moves and spins first and then arms move later
			more for heavier weapons and faster movement
		
		only input is target pos and rot of RH
		important variables: 
			input: transform of target of RH
			current transform of RH and
			weight of weapon in RH and 
			speed of movement
			current character velocity and look direction
how to limit scope if necessary:
	less inputs
	dont interpolate poses and do a smear VFX between limb positions
	zoom out or pixelate or blur etc
	refine one speed at a time
	less joints no knees no feet etc
	movement can be very robotic or puppet like doesnt have to be natural human like
	hardcode some whole body or limb animations
		like dash, leap, idle, roll, spin, flip, dance, grapple
	
typical situations:
	reset: return to neutral pose
	sword swing:
		movement 1: move sword slowly to point back and to back left when facing target
		movenent 2: move sword fast to point right and forward right pos
ideas for anims possible:
	sword swing
		top down
		bottom left to top right
		top right to bottom left
	parry
	block
	sword lunge
	3x sword spin attack
	astorias double flip overhead swing
	dash forward and attack 3x
	strafe dash

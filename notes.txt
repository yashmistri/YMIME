		2d lighting:
			3 lights at different sizes and intensities
			circle light makes all enemy types look like the same blob
			cone light faces cursor and fully illuminates enemies
			how to make lights illuminate south part of walls when south of walls only
		cheats system:
			toggle to enable cheats
			player invincible 'I'
			infinite abilties 'U'
			keyboard shortcuts to enable individual cheats
		enemies level up every 5 enemies defeated
			doesn't affect spawned enemies
			show enemy level next to hp
			enemy level scales stats
	character:
		have stats: health, damage, speed, level
	enemy:
		x spawn function
		x spawn node
		x damage player on contact
		
	player:
		fire projectile
			damage each tile in a line from player to max range
				make a ray and get all the tiles it intersects
				then
				vfx: magical spikes 
			or trigger one tile to damage on a delay while a projectile is animated from character to target
			make sure target only gets damaged once per cast
		fire projectile and make big tile explosion on collision
		cast damaging area on tiles around cursor
			restrict range to radius r
		cast expanding rings that trigger damage tiles
	game:
		menu: start, gameover, pause
		UI: health, abilities
		status effects: attach a node to a character when a status effect is applied
			node has a timer for duration and a timer for the interval in which the status effect is triggered
			negtive: on fire, slowed, stun
			positive: blocking, fast, more dmg
			damage received while stunned is increased
				this increase goes down with time
				
				rewards fast and efficient attacks and combos
			
	visuals:
		animate:
			enemies breathing
			light size
		put normal maps on blocks then put directional light?
		level up text 
		explosion warps circle area:
			use white circle texture as input to shader warp pixel and then expand circle
		highlight tile below cursor
			highlight circle of tiles around cursor
		animate meteor falling to tiles on casting damage area spell
			small meteors travel from target tile to far away tiles on impact
		short fire animation for one cell
		spark attack vfx for one cell
		spikes
			particle system with multiple spike sprites growing 
		lightning animation for one cell or maybe area
		make vfx highlighting a center point 
			make circle then scale to isometric y = 0.5
		character take damage:
			red, black liquid splatter
			red, white flash
			damage numbers animated
			skull anim on elimination
			health bar
		character:
			walk
			point weapon in direction
			eyes face direction
			show back when facing up
			special symbols for xp levels
	sounds:
		
	make/download isometric 2d sprites:
		angle/dimensions? try 45 degrees
		tiled? yes
		convert from 3d models? no
		tiles:
			or maybe abstract style
			grass
			trees
			decorations
			tall walls 
			small walls or obstacles
			floor tiles

	Make a simple isometric game
		make characters shoot projectiles
		x give characters hitbox
		make characters 2d sprites all animation procedural or in game
		x figure out how to get mouse position in world space
			make animated crosshair in world on click
		what to do about walls in front of/below player/camera
		what is game about:
			constantly spawning enemies in arena
			goal is survive for as long as possible while enemies get stronger
			player gets stronger by eliminating enemies
Bugs:
	x prevent area damage from spawning on walls
	x area damage not showing above tiles north of some location
		make them children of tile
	x enemy hurtbox disabled after hitting player
Notes:
Ideas:
	level is 2d sprites but characters are 3d models. need separate lights for 2d and 3d and some way to set both positions correctly
	make everything but area around cursor blurry or hidden
		always or as debuff?

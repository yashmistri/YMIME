	enemy:
		spawn function
		spawn node
		damage player on contact

			or trigger one tile to damage on a delay while a projectile is animated from character to target
			make sure target only gets damaged once per cast
		cast damaging area on tiles around cursor
	game:
		menu: start, gameover, pause

			negtive: on fire, slowed, stun
			positive: blocking, fast, more dmg

			damage numbers animated
			skull anim on elimination
			health bar
		character:
			walk

	sounds:
		
	make/download isometric 2d sprites:
		angle/dimensions? try 45 degrees
		tiled? yes
		convert from 3d models? no
		tiles:
			or maybe abstract style
			grass
			trees
			decorations

	Make a simple isometric game
		make characters shoot projectiles
		x give characters hitbox
		make characters 2d sprites all animation procedural or in game
		x figure out how to get mouse position in world space
			make animated crosshair in world on click
		what to do about walls in front of/below player/camera
		what is game about:
			constantly spawning enemies in arena
			goal is survive for as long as possible while enemies get stronger
			player gets stronger by eliminating enemies
Bugs:
	prevent area damage from spawning on walls
Notes:
Ideas:
	level is 2d sprites but characters are 3d models. need separate lights for 2d and 3d and some way to set both positions correctly

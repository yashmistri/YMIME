TODO:
	week 10/19
		x fix sprites turning black where overlap wall
			x shadow casting on wall showing over player sprite
		x put normal maps on blocks and use only one light mask may fix sprites turning black
			learn about specular texture
		x make humanoid in blender then port to godot and setup skeleton
			setup ik 
			make node for knees to bend toward set as ik magnet in code
		use procedural animation to animate walking
			x works with placeholder feet
			x make humanoid follow placeholder feet position
			make path for feet to follow when moving that mimics natural foot movement
			make sure rotation of feet only happens in y
		improve performance or fix stuttering on low spec machine:
			lock 3d world to low fps?
	week 10/26
		make shadows out of sprites using copy of sprite make black and set z level and skew
		add more 2d lights to scene with corresponding 3d lights
		add 3d blocks to 3d world where 2d walls are in order to block light correctly
	misc:
		2d lighting:
			3 lights at different sizes and intensities
			circle light makes all enemy types look like the same blob
			cone light faces cursor and fully illuminates enemies
			how to make lights illuminate south part of walls when south of walls only
			cast shadows on enemies and objects?
			flashlight
			make chars occlude 2d lights
			use 3d proj sprite for making a shadow for each light. start with only players flashlight
			put normal maps on blocks; simplify occluder system to just one block type
		3d:
			keep models out of GitHub repo?
			use procedural animation to animate character walking and running:
				foot stays while body moves until certain distance then foot moves in direction of movement
				use IK system
				slowly blends to special running curves and parameters when running
			how to make models y sort with walls properly
				separate each char model into a separate sprite by cutting up the viewport or the sprite
					prob doesnt work nicely if models overlap
						design game so models dont overlap
						use AABB to get exact bounding box in 2d?
						use bounding box algo to use one sprite for overlapping models?
					use alpha mask and shaders to send pixels to a texture for each model
					make only one model visible at a time and capture before moving on to next model
				one camera per model, each model lives in a separate world with all lights copied
				cut out parts of walls and move them up in z to cover models behidn them
			
			steps v2:
				get camera viewport texture and convert to image
				get position of model in camera space
				put dot on model
				put box around each model use fill_rect()
				cut out box in image and send each to a sprite child of each character
				design game so no characters ever overlap
					less enemies? enemies stay away from each other?
				render models really small but same distance away and upsize them in 2d then they wont overlap
			
			steps
			in one frame:
				move camera in front of each model
				capture and send image to each models corresponding sprite
				seems updating camera 2+ times a frame is not feasible
			
			x current vp texture is 10k x 10k even though most is invisible
				make it size of 2d camera
				move 3d camera with 2d camera
				
		increase performance on laptops
		cheats system:
			toggle to enable cheats
			player invincible 'I'
			infinite abilties 'U'
			keyboard shortcuts to enable individual cheats
		enemies level up every 5 enemies defeated
			doesn't affect spawned enemies
			show enemy level next to hp
			enemy level scales stats
	character:
		have stats: health, damage, speed, level
	enemy:
		turret with sweeping narrow red light cone
		floating heads with two independent moving eyes with lights attached
		x spawn function
		x spawn node
		x damage player on contact
		
	player:
		fire projectile
			damage each tile in a line from player to max range
				make a ray and get all the tiles it intersects
				then
				vfx: magical spikes 
			or trigger one tile to damage on a delay while a projectile is animated from character to target
			make sure target only gets damaged once per cast
		fire projectile and make big tile explosion on collision
		cast damaging area on tiles around cursor
			restrict range to radius r
		cast expanding rings that trigger damage tiles
	game:
		have places that player has to go to in a time limit
			show trail to place
				animate pulse going from player to goal
			place changes when player reaches and time limit decreases
		menu: start, gameover, pause
		UI: health, abilities
		status effects: attach a node to a character when a status effect is applied
			node has a timer for duration and a timer for the interval in which the status effect is triggered
			negtive: on fire, slowed, stun
			positive: blocking, fast, more dmg
			damage received while stunned is increased
				this increase goes down with time
				
				rewards fast and efficient attacks and combos
			
	visuals:
		models; render static models and normals to png (and depth buffer?):
			enemy:
				floating monster head: skeleton, man, monster
				robot turret
				floating snake
			environment:
				statues of people
			ghost enemies that slowly approach player from behind and disappear for a moment when flashlight is shined on them. deep red color?
				
		animate:
			enemies breathing
			light size
			orb light gradient colors: shift all positions right and loop
		tiles:
			use terrain sets to automatically set correct directions for tiles
			make a unique tile and sprite for every part of wall?:
				lone block
				face right and face left while connected on either side
				corners north south east west
				t joints
			figure out how to have different elevations and stairs bridges etc
		lights:
			make algorithm to get blocks that would be lit by flashlight and light them individually?
		x multiple lights around player to make fuzzy shadows
		put normal maps on blocks then put directional light?
		make columns put lamp sprite high up and point light at bottom
		slow projectiles with red lights pulsing with brightness color and size
		level up text 
		explosion warps circle area:
			use white circle texture as input to shader warp pixel and then expand circle
		highlight tile below cursor
			highlight circle of tiles around cursor
		animate meteor falling to tiles on casting damage area spell
			small meteors travel from target tile to far away tiles on impact
		short fire animation for one cell
		spark attack vfx for one cell
		spikes
			particle system with multiple spike sprites growing 
		lightning animation for one cell or maybe area
		make vfx highlighting a center point 
			make circle then scale to isometric y = 0.5
		character take damage:
			red, black liquid splatter
			red, white flash
			damage numbers animated
			skull anim on elimination
			health bar
		character:
			walk
			point weapon in direction
			eyes face direction
			show back when facing up
			special symbols for xp levels
	sounds:
		
	make/download isometric 2d sprites:
		angle/dimensions? try 45 degrees
		tiled? yes
		convert from 3d models? no
		tiles:
			or maybe abstract style
			grass
			trees
			decorations
			tall walls 
			small walls or obstacles
			floor tiles

	Make a simple isometric game
		make characters shoot projectiles
		x give characters hitbox
		make characters 2d sprites all animation procedural or in game
		x figure out how to get mouse position in world space
			make animated crosshair in world on click
		what to do about walls in front of/below player/camera
		what is game about:
			constantly spawning enemies in arena
			goal is survive for as long as possible while enemies get stronger
			player gets stronger by eliminating enemies
Bugs:
	x prevent area damage from spawning on walls
	x area damage not showing above tiles north of some location
		make them children of tile
	x enemy hurtbox disabled after hitting player
Notes:
Ideas:
	level is 2d sprites but characters are 3d models. need separate lights for 2d and 3d and some way to set both positions correctly
	make everything but area around cursor blurry or hidden
		always or as debuff?
